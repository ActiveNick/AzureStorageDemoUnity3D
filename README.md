# AzureStorageDemoUnity3D
Sample Unity project used to demonstrate the use of Azure Storage services in games and Mixed Reality projects. This app shows how you can upload/download blobs from Azure Storage using the basic Azure Storage SDK (Iâ€™m using the Win8 DLL for UWP), and you'll also have the ability to download blobs by segments of 1MB (configurable) which opens the door for tracking progress during the download.

# Demo Scenes
* AzureBlobStorageTest: Simple scene to demonstrate how to upload & download files to/from Azure Blob Storage, showcasing the Azure Transfer ProgressBar and the debug window. The spheres demonstrate the use of the BlobStorageTextureDownloader script.
* AzureBlobStorageVideoTest: Simple movie theater scene used to play video files downloaded from Azure Blob Storage. This scene reuses components and scripts from the [Unity Graphics Live Training: Playing Video in Unity](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/graphics/introduction-and-session-goals?playlist=17102).

## Implementation Notes
* The plugin DLL files are included in the source since they are specific versions selected for this project based on compatibility. The [Azure Storage DLL](https://www.nuget.org/packages/WindowsAzure.Storage/) is the Win8 version for the UWP build, and the .NET 4.5 version for the Unity editor.
* Note that this requires the .NET Scripting backend and support for .NET 4.6 Experimental in Unity. I have not tested this demo with IL2CPP yet.
* When running in the editor you CANNOT use https to connect to Blob Storage due to a certificates limitation in Unity, but https works fine in the UWP build.
* There is an extra button that showcases a blob download example script using the [Azure Storage Data Movement library](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Storage.DataMovement) and while it currently runs fine in the Unity editor, note that the UWP build export doesn't work. This is because Unity cannot handle a 16299 UWP DLL, so I decided to shelve DMLib for now until Unity 2018.1 adds support for .NET Standard 2.0.
