# AzureStorageDemoUnity3D
Sample Unity project used to demonstrate the use of Azure Storage services in games and Mixed Reality projects.

## Implementation Notes
* The plugin DLL files are included in the source since some of them are custom builds made specifically for this project.
* This example currently runs fine in the Unity editor but **the UWP build export still doesn't work**. This is a work in progress and there is still an issue with the Azure Storage Data Movement Library integration. Stay tuned.
